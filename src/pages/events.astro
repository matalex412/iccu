        Hub is our weekly meeting where we get together as a

        evangelism on campus.

        Curious is a great place to discover who Jesus is,
        what he did, and why it matters so much. This year,
        we will be doing this being going through John's
        gospel, which is a book in the Bible that gives a
        reliable eyewitness account of Jesus's story. This
        is led by group discussions, where anyone can feel
        free to share their thoughts, opinions, questions or
        concerns.

        We carry out sessions once a week during term time
        in a relaxed atmosphere, and as we understand the
        hustle of university life, the sessions are
        low-commitment (no homework!).
