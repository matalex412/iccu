      <p>
        At the Christian Union we know how important it is to be part of a local Christian
        community. Our belief is that every member of the CU should be part of a church.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Below is a list of local Churches that are popular with our CU members. This is by no means
        an exhaustive list, feel free to look around and find what suits you..
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        If you want to talk to a student who goes to one of these churches, please contact the CU
        via email or our social media and weâ€™ll happily put you in touch.
